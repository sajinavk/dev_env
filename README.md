## Quick Install

You can set up the environment using the code below:

### Download and run
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sajinavk/dev_env/main/env_setup.sh -O env_setup.sh
chmod +x env_setup.sh
sudo ./env_setup.sh
```

Before you scream Oh My Zsh! look over the `.zshrc` file to select plugins, themes, and options.
